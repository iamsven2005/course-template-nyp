## ðŸ”§ Technical Details
Here's a simple overview of how the NYPTECH Flask Document Generator processes your files to create a customized document.

### Image Extraction
The application automatically extracts images from your uploaded DOCX and XLSX files. This ensures that any visual content you include in your documents is preserved and incorporated into the final output.

**How It Works:**

1. **DOCX Files:**

    - DOCX files are essentially ZIP archives containing various components like text, images, and styles.
    - The application uses the zipfile library to open the DOCX file.
    - It searches for images stored in the word/media/ directory within the DOCX archive.
    - Each found image is read, encoded in base64 format, and added to the list of images to be included in the final document.

    def extract_images_as_base64(file_stream, file_extension):
        images_base64 = []

        if file_extension == 'docx':
            with zipfile.ZipFile(file_stream, 'r') as z:
                for file_name in z.namelist():
                    if file_name.startswith('word/media/'):
                        with z.open(file_name) as source_file:
                            image_data = source_file.read()
                            image_b64 = base64.b64encode(image_data).decode('utf-8')
                            images_base64.append((file_name, image_b64))
        # ...

        return images_base64

2. **XLSX Files:**

    - XLSX files can also contain embedded images.
    - Using the openpyxl library, the application loads the workbook and iterates through each sheet.
    - It extracts images from each sheet and encodes them in base64 format for inclusion in the final document.
    ``` bash 
    elif file_extension == 'xlsx':
        workbook = load_workbook(file_stream)
        for sheet in workbook.sheetnames:
            worksheet = workbook[sheet]
            for image in worksheet._images:
                image_data = image._data()
                image_b64 = base64.b64encode(image_data).decode('utf-8')
                images_base64.append((image.anchor._from, image_b64))


### Text Extraction
The application extracts specific sections of text from your uploaded DOCX files to include them in the generated document. This allows for a seamless integration of content from your source files into the final output.

**How It Works:**

1. **Identifying Sections:**

 - The application looks for predefined section headers (e.g., "Course Aims", "Course Learning Outcomes" within the DOCX file.
 - It extracts all the text between these sections to include relevant content in the final document.

2. **Implementation:**

    def extract_text_between_sections(file_path, start_section, end_section):
        doc = Document(file_path)
        extracting = False
        extracted_text = []
        
        for paragraph in doc.paragraphs:
            if start_section in paragraph.text:
                extracting = True
                continue
            
            if extracting and end_section in paragraph.text:
                break
            
            if extracting:
                extracted_text.append(paragraph.text)
        
        return "\n".join(extracted_text)

### Table Extraction
Tables from your uploaded DOCX files are automatically extracted and reformatted in the generated document. This ensures that structured data is accurately represented in the final output.

**How It Works:**

1. **Extracting Tables:**

The application uses the python-docx library to read tables from the uploaded DOCX file.
Each table is processed and added to the final document with appropriate formatting.

2. **Implementation:**

    def extract_tables_from_docx(doc_path):
        doc = Document(doc_path)
        tables = []
        for table in doc.tables:
            tables.append(table)
        return tables

3. **Adding Tables to the Final Document:**

    for table in tables:
        new_table = doc.add_table(rows=len(table.rows), cols=len(table.columns))
        new_table.style = 'Table Grid'

        for i, row in enumerate(table.rows):
            for j, cell in enumerate(row.cells):
                new_table.cell(i, j).text = cell.text
                # Additional formatting can be applied here
